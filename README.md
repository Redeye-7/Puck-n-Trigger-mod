# Puck-n-Trigger-mod

I love the reliability of the Hoyt St Puck Remote Control for Electric Skateboards, but wanted to use it as a trigger-style remote. So this mod is a quick way to bolt on the factory puck shell, replace the thumb wheel with a trigger mod, and you’re ready to go. You can even reuse the stock puck bolts (M2.5 x 20mm), though for long term use I’d go with M2.5 x 25mm for some extra threaded security. The optional picatinny rail for the occasional ride that goes after dark to slide on a flash light. If you want to attach the  picatinny rail, then you need M2.5 x 30mm bolts for those two holes. There is also a stash box in the handle to store your XT90 loop key, cash, and Schlüssel. 

I’m using the stock puck throttle spring and found the resistance too light for my taste, so looking at getting a stronger throttle spring from the Hoyt website.

I’ve printed this in both PLA and TPU. While PLA works fine, the TPU is the winner with feel and durability.
